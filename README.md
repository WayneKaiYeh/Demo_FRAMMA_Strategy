## ðŸ“Œ Key Features

- **Adaptive FRAMA Channel**

  Uses Stochastic RSI + RSI to classify oversold entries into **5 BUY scores** and overbought exits into **5 SELL scores**.

- **Zero-Lag EMA Trend Bands**  
  Fast trend flip detection with upper/lower deviation bands; generates â–²/â–¼ markers for regime change.

- **Multi-Timeframe Trend Consensus Table**  
  Aggregates signals from **5m, 15m, 60m, 4h, 1D** for higher confidence entries.

- **Position Sizing Suggestions** *(illustrative only)*

## ðŸ“ˆ High-Level Logic (Abstracted)

1. **Trend Context**  
   - Zero-Lag EMA deviation bands define bullish/bearish regime.  
   - FRAMA channel confirms momentum direction.

2. **Entry (BUY)**  
   - Stoch RSI + RSI identify oversold pullbacks within trend.  
   - Deeper dislocations â†’ higher BUY score (1â€“5).

3. **Exit (SELL)**  
   - Overbought signals combined with profit thresholds.  
   - Higher SELL score â†’ stronger take-profit bias.

4. **MTF Confirmation**  
   - Align lower timeframe entries with higher timeframe trend consensus.
