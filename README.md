# FRAMA Channel + Stoch RSI â€” Intraday Signal (Showcase)

![Hero](output/result.png)

Intraday trend-following & mean-reversion hybrid trading strategy, integrating an adaptive FRAMA channel for dynamic support/resistance, multi-layer Stochastic RSI + RSI scoring for precision entries/exits, a Zero-Lag EMA band for rapid trend detection, and a multi-timeframe (MTF) trend table to align signals across time horizons. Designed for high-confidence intraday decision-making while balancing momentum capture with disciplined profit-taking.

## Key Features

## ðŸ“Œ Key Features

- **Adaptive FRAMA Channel**  
  Automatically adjusts to volatility, with dynamic upper/lower bands and momentum-based colouring.  

  **Computation:**  
  i. Calculate Fractal Dimension  
     D = (ln(N1 + N2) âˆ’ ln(N3)) / ln(2)  
     where N1, N2, N3 are segment-normalised price ranges over different halves of the lookback window.  

  ii. Compute smoothing factor  
     Î± = e^(âˆ’4.6 Ã— (D âˆ’ 1))  

  iii. FRAMA midline  
     F_t = Î± Ã— P_t + (1 âˆ’ Î±) Ã— F_(tâˆ’1)  

  iv. Upper/Lower bands  
     F_t Â± ATR Ã— k

- **Multi-Layer Oscillator Filtering**  
  Uses Stochastic RSI + RSI to classify oversold entries into **5 BUY scores** and overbought exits into **5 SELL scores**.  

  **Computation:**  
  i. RSI  
     RSI_t = 100 âˆ’ 100 / (1 + RS_t)  
     where RS_t is the ratio of average gains to losses over a fixed period.  

  ii. Stochastic RSI %K  
     %K_t = ((RSI_t âˆ’ min(RSI)) / (max(RSI) âˆ’ min(RSI))) Ã— 100  

  iii. Apply smoothing to %K â†’ %D  

  iv. Score mapping: RSI & Stoch RSI thresholds mapped into score tiers (1â€“5) for BUY/SELL strength.

- **Zero-Lag EMA Trend Bands**  
  Fast trend flip detection with upper/lower deviation bands; generates â–²/â–¼ markers for regime change.  

  **Computation:**  
  i. Zero-Lag EMA  
     ZLEMA_t = EMA(P_t + (P_t âˆ’ P_(tâˆ’lag)), L)  
     where lag = (L âˆ’ 1) / 2  

  ii. Deviation bands  
     Upper = ZLEMA_t + m Ã— ATR(L)  
     Lower = ZLEMA_t âˆ’ m Ã— ATR(L)  

  iii. Trend state flips when price crosses above/below bands, confirmed by consecutive bar conditions.


- **Multi-Timeframe Trend Consensus Table**  
  Aggregates signals from **5m, 15m, 60m, 4h, 1D** for higher confidence entries.

- **Position Sizing Suggestions** *(illustrative only)*  
  BUY score drives light/core/heavy allocation hints.

## High-Level Logic (Abstracted)

1. **Trend Context**  
   - Zero-Lag EMA deviation bands define bullish/bearish regime.  
   - FRAMA channel confirms momentum direction.

2. **Entry (BUY)**  
   - Stoch RSI + RSI identify oversold pullbacks within trend.  
   - Deeper dislocations â†’ higher BUY score (1â€“5).

3. **Exit (SELL)**  
   - Overbought signals combined with profit thresholds.  
   - Higher SELL score â†’ stronger take-profit bias.

4. **MTF Confirmation**  
   - Align lower timeframe entries with higher timeframe trend consensus.
